#Project Overview
>*Heart of Gold* and "Study Buddy" aim to adapt the idea of the popular social media app Tinder and apply it to finding a compatible study partner. The app will collect personal information and class schedule from users and then offer them matches. If both matches pick each other, they will be able to chat and coordinate study sessions.

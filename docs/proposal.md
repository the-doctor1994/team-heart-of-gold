##Problem Statement
There are many unnecessary stresses associated with higher education. Educational growth is usually accompanied by various sources of stress, such as worrying about grades or finding people to study with. We aim to streamline and simplify these processes in order to make life easier for those who have enough to worry about.

While some people may need to be shown how to things multiple times, someone else may learn best when they have to teach new ideas to others. Many enjoy bouncing quesitons off of peers, but often find themselves taking courses with unfamiliar faces. Others may simply enjoy sharing their knowledge with others.

No two people learn or study the same way, but any student knows that studying together often results in better performance. We at Heart of Gold seek to make finding study partners as simple and effective as possible.

By analyzing our users' personal study preferences, our matches are tailored individually. People who prefer to study in silence  are not as likely to be matched with someone who always studys with background noise. As less obvious example, those who prefer to learn something when it's drawn out on a whiteboard are likely to be matched with those who prefer explaining themselves while drawing or writing on a whiteboard.

Existing person matching services oftentimes approach matching at a different angle. Rather than connecting people based on what is believed to make them attracted to eachther as friends, or more, we at Heart of Gold believe that matching people based on their studying habits and current courses will provide acedemic benefits.

##Product Description
When a new user visits our site, they will be greeted with an intitive and simple interface, with which they will be guided through the creation of their personal profile. Here our users will enter enter basic information, such as their place of accademia and major, followed by more personale information such as currently enrolled courses and perfered study habbits. 

Once our user has created a profile, we will begin formulating suggested sudy partners for our user. Using our suer's pernal information and preferences, allong with that of all of our other users, we can match each user with other users who have the most simmilarities. These suggested matches are presnted to the user through their browser. From this point, our user's have the final decision as to whether or not they want to connect with a suggested match, or to pass on the matched study partner.'

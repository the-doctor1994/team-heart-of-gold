##Team Members
###**Brenton Chasse** - Backend/Databases
I am a senior Computer Systems Engineering student pursuing a minor in Computer Science. I work for and have accepted a full time job offer with IBM. Within "Software Group", I am part of a team developing a web app referred to as "Verse" where I have become familiar with using JavaScript and the Dojo toolkit for front end development.

I will be designing and implementing the database and associated backend support.

CMPSCI 121 (Intro to Java), CMPSCI 250 (Discrete Math), CMPSCI 377 (Operating Systems)

###**Gary White** - Frontend/UI
I am a junior Computer Science major, with prior team working experience from Software Engineering in CMPSCI 326. Most of my role in that project was making sure that the user interface and the backend were able to communicate well. Portions that I worked on front end things were exciting to me because I was interested in being able to tie pieces together. I am excited to be part of this team and this project.

###**Grayson Kempster** - Backend/Databases
I am a Junior Computer Science major with a focus on physics. I work as an RA in Washington Tower in the SouthWest residence area. I was raised in a small town called Hopedale in MA where I earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the local Boy Scout troop. I am good at creative problem solving, and have experience with Java, JavaScript, HTML, C, and UNIX. In terms of this project I am interested in database management, graphic design, and function design.

###**Main Khan** - Networking/Data Parsing
I am a Sophomore Computer Science and Computational Mathematics double major under the software engineering track. I enjoy working on the user experience and user interface aspects of development. Over the summer I worked on Foldit, a game that uses crowdsourcing to research protein folding. I'm looking forward to working on a large scale group project such as this one.

###**Philron Hozier** - Frontend/UI
Currently a Junior @UMass Amherst pursuing a BS Computer Science degree. My interest in CS is the design of software and user experience. I have some past experience developing two, rather small, mobile applications with a friend in Objective C for iOS (teacher absentee app, music lyric app).

###**Tyler Caldwell** - Networking/Data Parsing
I am a junior CS-BA/Econ major. I'm interested in software engineering and data analysis in the financial sector. I've worked for BNY Mellon and State Street Bank, and this summer I'll be working at Fidelity Investments in a data science role.

##Problem Statement
There are many unnecessary stresses associated with higher education. Educational growth is usually accompanied by various sources of stress, such as worrying about grades or finding people to study with. We aim to streamline and simplify these processes in order to make life easier for those who have enough to worry about.

While some people need to be taught a concept multiple times, others learn best by teaching. Many students enjoy learning in a team, but find themselves in a class of unfamiliar faces. And some students simply enjoy sharing their knowledge with others.

People learn in very different ways, but most students understand the value of studying together. We at Heart of Gold seek to make finding study partners as quick and easy as possible.

By cataloguing our users' classes and preferences, we provide a consolidated network for finding matches tailored to individual academic needs. For example, people who prefer to study in silence are less likely to be matched with someone who prefers studying with background noise. Similarly, those who prefer to learn visually are more likely to be matched with those who prefer the same.

Just as existing matching services such as [Tinder](http://www.gotinder.com/) believe that connecting people based on what will make them attracted to each other as friends or more will increase one's happiness; we at Heart of Gold believe that matching people based on their studying habits and current courses will provide academic benefits.

##Product Description
When a new user visits our site, they will be greeted with an intuitive and simple interface that will guide them through the creation of their profile. Here our users will enter basic information, such as their name, age, and major, followed by more personal information such as a short bio, currently enrolled courses, and preferred study habits (music, location, willing travel distance, learning type). 

Once a user has created their profile, we will begin creating matches and suggesting study partners for them. Using our algorithms, we will rank the user's matches on a scale of more to less "study compatible." This line-up of matches is then presented to the user through their mobile/full browser. From this point, our users have the final decision as to whether or not they want to connect with a suggested match, or to pass on the matched study partner. Users will only be notified of another user's choice if they both say yes; thus making them "study buddies." Only then will they be able to contact each other to organize a meeting.

##What Void Do We Fill?
In the world of college social media there are many networks, all of them unique; all of them with a clear purpose. Networks for posting pictures anonymously(or not), posting "tweets" anonymously (or not), meeting up with or talking to people who find you attractive, and even for trying to affirm your brand to prospective employers and the professional community. But no such network exists for enriching your academic experience. This, is the void we aim to fill.

##Timeline
The initial research for the application is already well-established, and is nearing completion. By February 28th, this should be complete. Research has included surface-level market research (ensuring the originality of the product, examining similar or potentially competing products) as well as some brainstorming about actual implementation (platforms, frameworks, libraries, toolkits, etc.).

Design will begin immediately following the completion of research. Final design documents should be completed by March 14. This will include a full descriptive design of data structures, the architecture of the full stack, and the UI.

The basic interface should be functional by March 27th. This will include basic frontend functionality.

The interface should be roughly functional in conjunction with the backend by April 09th, and the application should be functioning on a basic level.

By April 16th the application should be mostly functional, and the implementation of the final features will be finished up.

Final debugging/testing will begin on April 20, and continue until submission of final product.

The final implementation of the application will be completed by April 28th.

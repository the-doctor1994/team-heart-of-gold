# Project: Profile

**Overall**: The formatting is nice here. If you can find a higher resolution version of the gold heart (or make one), I think you can get away with just having the heart without the overlaying text.

**Idea**: This is definitely an interesting idea. I like the thought of being able to find someone to study with, or perhaps someone to just work with for some assignment in a hard class. I’m curious to see the details you come up with for this idea in the future.

**Bios**: I thought these were ok. There was a lot of the cookie-cutter “I’m this major and want to do or that” type of stuff, which is fine, but the bio needs to have more info about who you are outside of CS as well. What do you like to do for fun? Are there any fun facts about you? Your bio should be informative, but it should also be a little interesting. The investor isn’t only investing your idea, they’re investing in you, so try and show a little more of you that isn't easily discernible from a resume.

**Overall Grade**: Thumbs up! Good job

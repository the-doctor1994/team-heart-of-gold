# Project 4

**Overall:** Your design specification was alright. You seem to have everything needed, but it looks like things are a little barren. It would have been nice to have seen more detail on "how" things will be implemented. I do like that you nicely listed out the dependencies for pages. Your team notes look mostly fine, but you NEED to include the participants of the meeting.

**Grade:** Thumbs up

# Project 3

**Overall:** I thought your submission was good overall. I appreciated the Key & Peele reference with the names in the use cases section. The wireframe and flowchart looked good. In your open issues, I notice a few of your issues were messaging related. You might want to check out Socket.io . I think it might solve most of your messaging system issues.

Overall **thumbs up**

# Project: Proposal

**Overall:**  The formatting of everything is nice. The bios were ok. I like the idea of being able to find people to study with for classes--especially for classes that are certainly tough like 250 and 311. I am looking forward to seeing how this is going to turn out. 

**Idea/Problem Statement:** The idea seems to be a good one, and could help many students--especially those in the more math/science related classes. I'm looking forward to see how well your matching algorithm works. 

**Timeline:** Your timeline looks good and reasonable.

**Funding:** The budget is the only thing I have a problem with. These numbers aren't crazy, and perhaps are even underestimates, for a company that already has its foot on the ground and has money to spend, but they aren't start-up numbers. 

First, the salaries. For a company trying to get their first bit of funding, members most likely wouldn't be seeing these salaries--they'd most likely get enough to cover living expenses, but not much extra. A fresh, newly created start-up typically doesn't have the ability to pay the starting employees a competitive salary. That comes later when the company becomes something and is able to receive more funding. 

Second, when it comes to the hardware, I'm not sure why you would need 9,000. You shouldn't be buying server equipment at a stage when you're trying to gain users. At this stage, using other options like DigitalOcean are much more cost effective. If it's for laptops instead of server equipment, still no need for money to be going towards that outlet at this point as well--unless someone has a machine on the verge of dying. 

Third, the advertising cost. This number isn't a bad one, especially since advertising can cost that in a day. However, with this product appealing to mostly college students, you shouldn't need an advertising budget to be able to reach out to these people. At UMass alone, we have Facebook groups, Yik Yak, Fade and that are highly used by students. It's generally not too hard to each out to RSO's on campus. You can reach a ton of users without having to spend 2k in a month. I wouldn't include an advertising budget until later on when you needed to grow past the initial college student hump.

I will say though, I do like the fact you thought about legal fees. You might've been conservative with the legal fee price.

**Overall Grade:** Although I have problems with the budget, I will still give a thumbs up and fully fund this company--though not for the full amount. My funding would include a reduced salary in the 20-30/hr range and without the hardware cost. The team seems capable of bringing this idea to life though. Feel free to resubmit the budget, or any explaination if you think I was too harsh on the budget and to explain it more.


# Project: Profile

**Overall**: The formatting is nice here. If you can find a higher resolution version of the gold heart (or make one), I think you can get away with just having the heart without the overlaying text.

**Idea**: This is definitely an interesting idea. I like the thought of being able to find someone to study with, or perhaps someone to just work with for some assignment in a hard class. I’m curious to see the details you come up with for this idea in the future.

**Bios**: I thought these were ok. There was a lot of the cookie-cutter “I’m this major and want to do or that” type of stuff, which is fine, but the bio needs to have more info about who you are outside of CS as well. What do you like to do for fun? Are there any fun facts about you? Your bio should be informative, but it should also be a little interesting. The investor isn’t only investing your idea, they’re investing in you, so try and show a little more of you that isn't easily discernible from a resume.

**Overall Grade**: Thumbs up! Good job
